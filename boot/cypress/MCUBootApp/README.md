* Can validate image hash of 2 slots in flash memory BOOT and UPGRADE
* Starts image located in BOOT slot after validating signature
* Performs upgrade operation from UPGRADE slot to BOOT slot after UPGRADE image hash verification

Flags by defalt:

`BUILDCFG=Debug`
`MAKEINFO=0`

**How to program MCUBoot Bootloader:**

Use any preffered tool for programming hex files.

Currently implemented makefile jobs use DAPLINK interface for programming.

To program Bootloader image use following command:

`make load APP_NAME=MCUBootApp TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W-M0`

**Example terminal output:**

When user application programmed in BOOT slot:

`[INF] MCUBoot Bootloader Started`

`[INF] User Application validated successfully`

`[INF] Starting User Application on CM4 (wait)â€¦`
