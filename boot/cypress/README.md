# Downloading Solution's Assets

There are four assets required:

* MCUBooot Library (root repository)
* PSoC6 BSP Library
* PSoC6 Peripheral Drivers Library (PDL)
* mbedTLS Cryptographic Library

Those are present as submodules.

To retrive working environment, root repo has to be cloned recursively:

__git clone --recursive https://github.com/JuulLabs-OSS/mcuboot.git__

As next step submodules have to be updated:

__git submodule update --init__
